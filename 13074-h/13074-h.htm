    <p><i>Mrs. G.-G.</i> I see that the proprietors of <i>All
    Sorts</i> are going to follow the American example, and offer a
    prize of £20 to the wife who makes out the best case for her
    husband as a Model. It's just as well, perhaps, that you should
    know that I've made up my mind to enter <i>you</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. G.-G.</i> (<i>gratified</i>). My dear CORNELIA!
    really, I'd no idea you had such a&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. G.-G.</i> Nonsense! The drawing-room carpet is a
    perfect disgrace, and, as you can't, or won't, provide the
    money in any <i>other</i> way, why&mdash;Would you like to hear
    what I've said about you?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. G.-G.</i> Well, if you're sure it wouldn't he
    troubling you too much, I <i>should</i>, my dear.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. G.-G.</i> Then sit where I can see you, and listen.
    (<i>She reads.</i>) "Irreproachable in all that pertains to
    morality"&mdash;(and it would be a bad day indeed for you,
    GALAHAD, if I ever had cause to think
    <i>otherwise</i>.')&mdash;"morality; scrupulously dainty and
    neat in his person"&mdash;(ah, you may well blush, GALAHAD,
    but, fortunately, they won't want me to <i>produce</i>
    you!)&mdash;"he imports into our happy home the delicate
    refinement of a <i>preux chevalier</i> of the olden time."
    (Will you kindly take your dirty boots off the steel fender!)
    "We rule our little kingdom with a joint and equal sway, to
    which jealousy and friction are alike unknown; he, considerate
    and indulgent to my womanly weakness,"&mdash;(You need not
    stare at me in that perfectly idiotic fashion!)&mdash;"I,
    looking to him for the wise and tender support which has never
    yet been denied. The close and daily scrutiny of many years has
    discovered"&mdash;(What are you shaking like <i>that</i>
    for?)&mdash;"discovered no single weakness; no taint or flaw of
    character; no irritating trick of speech or habit." (How often
    have I told you that I will <i>not</i> have the handle of that
    paper-knife sucked? Put it down; do!) "His
    conversation&mdash;sparkling but ever spiritual&mdash;renders
    our modest meals veritable feasts of fancy and flows of soul
    ... <i>Well</i>, GALAHAD?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. G.-G.</i> Nothing, my dear; nothing. It struck me as
    well,&mdash;a trifle <i>flowery</i>, that last passage, that's
    all!</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. G.-G.</i> (<i>severely</i>). If I cannot expect to
    win the prize without descending to floweriness, whose fault is
    <i>that</i>, I should like to know? If you can't make sensible
    observations, you had better not speak at all.
    (<i>Continuing</i>,) "Over and over again, gathering me in his
    strong loving arms, and pressing fervent kisses upon my
    forehead, he has cried, 'Why am I not a Monarch that so I could
    place a diadem upon that brow? With such a Consort, am I not
    doubly crowned?'" Have you anything to say to <i>that</i>,
    GALAHAD?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. G.-G.</i> Only, my love, that I&mdash;I don't seem to
    remember having made that particular remark.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. G.-G.</i> Then make it <i>now</i>. I'm sure I wish
    to be as accurate as I <i>can</i>. [Mr. G.-G. <i>makes the
    remark&mdash;but without fervour.</i></p>

    <h4>SCENE THE SECOND&mdash;<i>At the</i> MONARCH-JONES'.</h4>

    <p><i>Mr. M.-J.</i> Twenty quid would come in precious handy
    just now, after all I've dropped lately, and I mean to pouch
    that prize if I can&mdash;so just you sit down, GRIZZLE, and
    write out what I tell you; do you hear?</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. M.-J.</i> (<i>timidly</i>). But, MONARCH, dear,
    would that be quite <i>fair</i>? No, don't be angry, I didn't
    mean that&mdash;I'll write whatever you please!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. M.-J.</i> You'd <i>better</i>, that's all! Are you
    ready? I must screw myself up another peg before I begin.
    (<i>He screws</i>.) Now, then. (<i>Stands over her and
    dictates</i>.) "To the polished urbanity of a perfect
    gentleman, he unites the kindly charity of a true Christian."
    (Why the devil don't you learn to write decently, eh?)
    "Liberal, and even lavish, in all his dealings, he is yet a
    stern foe to every kind of excess"&mdash;(Hold on a bit, I must
    have another nip after that)&mdash;"every kind of excess. Our
    married life is one long dream of blissful contentment, in
    which each contends with the other in loving self-sacrifice."
    (Haven't you corked all that down <i>yet</i>!) "Such cares and
    anxieties as he has, he conceals from me with scrupulous
    consideration as long as possible"&mdash;(Gad, I should be a
    fool if I <i>didn't</i>!)&mdash;"while I am ever sure of
    finding in him a patient and sympathetic listener to all my
    trifling worries and difficulties."&mdash;(<i>Two</i> f's in
    difficulties, you little fool&mdash;can't you even
    <i>spell</i>?) "Many a time, falling on his knees at my feet,
    he has rapturously exclaimed, his accents broken by manly
    emotion, 'Oh, that I were more worthy of such a pearl among
    women! With such a helpmate, I am indeed to be envied!'" That
    <i>ought</i> to do the trick. If I don't romp in after
    that!&mdash;(<i>Observing that</i> Mrs. M.-J.'s <i>shoulders
    are convulsed</i>.) What the dooce are you giggling at
    <i>now</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. M.-J.</i> I&mdash;I wasn't giggling, MONARCH dear,
    only&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Mr. M.-J.</i> Only <i>what</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. M.-J.</i> Only crying!</p>

    <h4>THE SEQUEL.</h4>

    <p>"The Judges appointed by the spirited proprietors of <i>All
    Sorts</i> to decide the 'Model Husband Contest'&mdash;which was
    established on lines similar to one recently inaugurated by one
    of our New York contemporaries&mdash;have now issued their
    award. Two competitors have sent in certificates which have
    been found equally deserving of the prize; viz., Mrs. CORNELIA
    GALAHAD-GREEN, Graemair Villa, Peckham, and Mrs. GRISELDA
    MONARCH-JONES, Aspen Lodge, Lordship Lane. The sum of Twenty
    Pounds will consequently be divided between these two ladies,
    to whom, with their respective spouses, we beg to tender our
    cordial felicitations."&mdash;(<i>Extract from Daily Paper,

    <p>For some months Society has been on the tip-toe of
    expectation with regard to the new Tragedy by Mr. SHAKSPEARE
    SMITHSON, which is to inaugurate the magnificent Theatre, built
    at a sumptuous and total disregard of expense by Mr. DILEY
    PUFF, a lineal descendant of the great PUFF family, by
    intermarriage with the more recent CRUMMLES's, expressly for
    the performance of the genuine English Drama. A veil of secrecy
    has, however, been drawn over all the arrangements connected
    with the new production. One after another the Author, the
    Manager, and the leading Actors were appealed to in vain.
    Finally, one of Our Representatives taking his courage in both
    hands, brought it and himself safely to the stage-door of the
    new theatre, and knocked. After some hesitation he was admitted
    by an intelligent boy, who, however, at first seemed indisposed
    to be drawn into conversation, though he admitted he had been
    engaged for the responsible post of call-boy at an inadequate
    salary. Our Representative managed to interest the lad in the
    inspection of a numismatic representation of Her Most Gracious
    Majesty, which he happened to have brought with him on the back
    of half-a-crown, and with which Our Representative toyed,
    holding it between the thumb and dexter finger of the right
    hand. We give the result in Our Representative's own
    words:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Come this way," said the boy, on whom the sight of the coin
    seemed to operate like some weird talisman, leading me to a
    remote part of the stage, the floor of which had been
    tastefully littered with orange-peel in a variety of patterns;
    "we shall be comfortabler."</p>

    <p>"Now tell me," I said, "about this new piece."</p>

    <p>"It's what they call a Tragedy," said the boy.</p>

    <p>"Ah!" I replied, "that is interesting; but I want to know
    about the Author. What do you think of him?"</p>

    <p>"The horther? Oh my!" said the precocious lad, producing an
    apple from his trousers' pocket, but his right eye still fixed
    on the talisman, "'e don't count. Why we none of us pays no
    attention to 'im. Crikey, you should 'a seen 'im come a cropper
    on his nut down them new steps. But, look 'ere, Sir," he
    continued, more solemnly, "I'm a tellin' yer secrets, I am; and
    if DILEY were to 'ear of it, I'd get a proper jacketin'. Swear
    you won't peach."</p>

    <p>I gave the requisite pledge. "And that ere arf-crown?" he
    said. I nodded assent to what was evidently in his mind. Then
    he resumed. "It's a beautiful piece. The play, I mean," he
    explained; being fearful lest I should consider him as
    over-eager for the coveted and covenanted reward. "I'm sure o'
    that. The horther says so, and DILEY says so, and Miss O'GRADY
    says so; she's got the 'eroine to play,&mdash;and oh, don't she
    die in the lawst Act just proper, with pink light and a couple
    o' angels to carry 'er up! Then there's Mr. KEANE 'ARRIS, 'e
    touches 'em all up with 'is sword, 'places his back to the
    wall, and defies the mob,' is what the book says. So you may
    take it from me, it's fust-rate."</p>

    <p>I thanked my intelligent little friend for his information,
    and was proceeding to put a further question about the music
    for this new Drama, which, as everyone will soon know, is to be
    a real <i>chef d'oeuvre</i> of Sir HAUTHOR SUNNIVUN, when a
    step was heard approaching across the stage&mdash;the deepest,
    by the way, in London&mdash;to where we were talking.</p>

    <p>"That's 'im," said the boy, trembling. "'E's a noble-'earted
    master, so kind and generous, but 'e 'ates deception, and it
    would be more than my place is worth to let 'im catch me
    talking these 'ere dead secrets to you. Give us the coin. I'm
    orf!"</p>

    <p>And, before I was able to carry out my portion of the
    contract, he was gone. And in another moment&mdash;so was
    I.</p>

    seen the Koh-i-Noor.</p>

    <p><i>He</i>. But they wanted them for the one at the Tower,
    don't you know, and as for the Koh-i-Noor, was <i>that</i>
    invented in his time?</p>

    <p><i>She</i>. Perhaps it wasn't. Stay, wasn't it discovered by
    Captain COOK, or DRAKE, or somebody?</p>

    <p><i>He</i>. I daresay. I have never looked the matter up.
    <i>À propos</i>, One-pound Bank-notes are to be issued.</p>

    <p><i>She</i>. Are they? I suppose they will be useful for
    change?</p>

    <p><i>He</i>. Shouldn't be astonished, but don't pretend to
    know anything about it. By the way, do you take much interest
    in the subjects we have been discussing?</p>

    <p><i>She</i>. Not the faintest.</p>

    <p><i>He</i>. No more do I! [<i>Waltz continued.</i></p>

    <h2>BRUSTLES' BISHOP.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By a Muddled Moralist.</i>)</h4>

    <h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

    <p>BEN BRUSTLES was only a poor shoeblack-boy who cleaned
    boots&mdash;ay, and even shoes, for his daily bread. Such time
    as he could spare from his avocation he devoted to diligent
    study of the doctrine of chance, as exemplified in the practice
    of pitch-and-toss. Often and often, after pitching and tossing
    in the cold wet streets for long weary hours, he would return
    home without a halfpenny. Think of this, ye more fortunate
    youths, who sit at home at ease, and play Loto for nuts! But
    through all his vicissitudes, BEN kept a stout heart, never
    losing his conviction that something&mdash;he knew not
    what&mdash;would eventually turn up. Sometimes it was heads, at
    others tails: and in either case the poor boy lost money by
    it&mdash;but he persevered notwithstanding, confident that
    Fortune would favour him at last. It is this spirit of
    undaunted enterprise that has made our England what it is!</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/64-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/64-1.png"
             alt="Brustles Blacking." /></a>Brustles Blacking.
    </div>

    <p>And one day Fortune did favour him. He observed, as he knelt
    before his box, a portly and venerable person close by, who was
    engrossed in studying, with apparent complacency, his own
    reflection in a plate-glass shop-front. So naïve a display of
    personal vanity, in one whose dress and demeanour denoted him a
    Bishop, not unnaturally excited BENJAMIN's interest, nor was
    this lessened when the stranger, after shaking his head
    reproachfully at his reflected image, advanced to the
    shoe-black's box as if in obedience to a sudden impulse.</p>

    <p>"My lad," he said, with a certain calm dignity, "will you be
    so good as to black both my legs for me&mdash;at once?"</p>

    <p>This unusual request, conceived as it was on a larger scale
    than the orders he habitually received, startled the youth,
    particularly as he noted that the symmetrical and well-turned
    limb which the Bishop extended consisted, like its fellow, of a
    rare and costly species of mahogany, and shone with the rich
    and glossy hue of a newly-fallen horse-chestnut, "I see,"
    commented the Bishop, with a melancholy smile, "that you have
    already discovered that my lower members are the
    product&mdash;not of Nature, but of Art. It was not always thus
    with me&mdash;but in my younger days I was an ardent
    climber&mdash;indeed, I am still an Honorary Member of the
    Hampstead Heath Alpine Club. Many years since, whilst scaling
    Primrose Hill, I was compelled, by a sudden storm, to take
    refuge in a half-way hut, where I passed the night, exposed to
    all the rigours of an English Midsummer! When I awoke I found,
    to my surprise, that both my legs had been bitten by the
    relentless frost short off immediately below the knee, and I
    had to continue the ascent next day in a basket. On descending,
    I caused these substitutes to be fashioned, and on them I
    stumped my way to the exalted position I now fill, nor have I
    ever evinced any physical inconveniences from my misfortune,
    save in one particular&mdash;that it has rendered the
    assumption of gaiters unhappily out of the question! But,
    possibly, my wish to have these legs of mine disguised by your
    pigments, strikes you as bizarre, if not positively eccentric?
    You will better understand my reasons after you have heard a
    confession which, though necessary, is, believe me, painful to
    make." And the good old man, after a short internal struggle,
    began the following narrative, which we reserve for a
    succeeding chapter.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

    <p>"Even as a Curate, a certain harmless vanity was ever my
    besetting weakness. I might, indeed, have hoped that, after my
    accident&mdash;but see, my good lad, how pride may lurk, even
    in our very infirmities! These artificial limbs have become a
    yet subtler snare to me than even those they replaced. I had
    them constructed, as you see, of the best mahogany&mdash;to
    match the furniture in my dining-room. With ever-increasing
    pleasure, my eyes have gloried in their grain and gloss, in the
    symmetry of their curves, in the more than Chinese delicacy of
    their extremities, until gradually they have trampled upon my
    better self, they have run away with all my possibilities of
    moral usefulness! Yes, but this very moment, as I stood
    admiring their contour at yonder window, the pernicious thought
    crossed my mind that their appearance would be yet more
    enhanced if I had them <i>gilded</i>!"</p>

    <p>"But, your reverent Lordship," objected BRUSTLES, as the
    Bishop paused, overcome by humiliation, "it's no use coming to
    <i>me</i> for that 'ere job!" For, though but a poor boy, he
    was too honest to accept any commission under false pretences.
    Gilding, he knew, might&mdash;and, in a London atmosphere, soon
    would&mdash;become black, but no boot-polish would ever assume
    the appearance, even of the blackest gilt, and so he candidly
    explained to the Bishop.</p>

    <p>"I know, my boy," said the latter, patting BEN's head kindly
    with the handle of his umbrella, "I know. Hence my application
    to your skill. That presumptuous idea revealed as in a
    lightning flash the abyss on the brink of which I stood. This
    demon of perverse pride must be laid; humbled for ever. So ply
    your brushes, and see you spare not the blacking!"</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

    <p>BRUSTLES obeyed&mdash;not without awe, and in a short space
    of time two pots of blacking were exhausted, and the roseate
    glow of the Bishop's mahogany limbs was for ever hidden under a
    layer of more than Nubian ebony!</p>

    <p>"'Selp me, your lordly reverence," he cried, dazzled by the
    brilliancy of the result; "but you might be took, below, for a
    Lifeguardsman!"</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/64-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/64-2.png"
             alt="Bilked by a Bishop." /></a>Bilked by a Bishop.
    </div>

    <p>"Hush," said the Bishop, though with a gratification he
    could not restrain, "would you recall the demon I strove to
    exorcise! It is true that the change is less of a disfigurement
    than I feared&mdash;ahem, <i>hoped</i>&mdash;but after all, may
    not the wish to please the eye of man be excusable? You shall
    receive a rich reward. Do you happen to have such a thing as
    change for a five-pound note about you?"</p>

    <p>"Alas!" replied the lad, with ready presence of mind, "but I
    have only just paid all my gold into my bank for the day!"</p>

    <p>"No matter," said the Bishop, gently. "I find I have a
    threepenny bit, after all. It is yours!" And the good
    ecclesiastic, as if to avoid thanks, moved nimbly off, though
    his eyes still sought the shop-windows as he passed, with even
    greater complacency than before.</p>

    <p>BEN tested the threepenny bit between his teeth&mdash;it was
    a spurious coin; he looked up, but his late customer was
    already passed out of hearing of his sentiments. He sank down
    with his head laid amongst his pots and brushes. "Bilked!" he
    moaned piteously, "bilked&mdash;and by a blooming Bishop!"</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

    <p>But mark the sequel. The good Bishop had been quite ignorant
    that the threepenny bit was a pewter one; quite sincere, for
    the time, in his determination to subdue his own weakness.
    Still it was not to be: inbred pride is not so easily
    vanquished&mdash;even by Bishops! The Bishop learned to glory
    in his blacking far more than he had ever done in the original
    mahogany. He had it continually renewed, and with the most
    expensive compositions. He would bend enraptured over the
    burnished surfaces of his extended legs, gazing, like another
    Narcissus, at the features he saw so faithfully repeated.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile the threepence, base as it was, became the humble
    instrument of brighter fortunes to BRUSTLES; it showed a
    marvellous <span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"
       id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span> aptitude for turning up
       tails, which BEN no sooner perceived than he availed himself
       of a blessing that had, indeed, come to him in disguise!</p>

    <p>But the Bishop&mdash;what of him? Nemesis overtook him at
    last. The discontent long smouldering in his diocese broke out
    into a climax. Thousands of Curates, inflamed by professional
    agitators, went out on strike, and their first victim was the
    Bishop of TIMBERTOWS, who was discovered prostrate one dark
    night by his horrified Chaplain. He had been picketed as a
    Blackleg!</p>

    <h2>PLAYTIME FOR A DOLL'S HOUSE.</h2>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;According to a well-known Critic,
    writing of a morning performance of <i>The Doll's House</i> on
    Tuesday, the 27th ult., at Terry's Theatre, "There is no need
    to discuss IBSEN's piece any more." I will go a little further,
    and say, not only should the play be spared discussion, but
    also performance. All that could be done for this miserable
    drama (if a work utterly devoid of dramatic interest can be so
    entitled) was effected some years since, when <i>Breaking a
    Butterfly</i>, a version with Messrs. HERMAN and JONES as
    adapters, was played at the Prince's (now Prince of Wales's)
    Theatre. I believe some one or other has said that that version
    was misleading, because it modified IBSEN, and did not reveal
    him in his true colours. This I can readily believe, as my
    recollection of <i>Breaking a Butterfly</i> merely suggests
    boredom; whereas, when I consider <i>The Doll's House</i> of
    Tuesday, I distinctly mingle with boredom a recollection of
    something that caused a feeling of absolute loathing. That
    something, I imagine, must be the new matter which was absent
    from the first version, and crops up in the text of the second,
    which, according to the Play-bill, appears "in Vol. I. of the
    authorised edition of IBSEN's Prose Dramas, edited by WILLIAM
    ARCHER, and published by Mr. WALTER SCOTT." By the way, I must
    confess that, although the name of the Editor is not familiar
    to me as a dramatic author, his superintendence of the
    authorised text seems to have been performed sufficiently
    creditably to have rendered him as worthy of an honourable
    prefix as the publisher. Why omit the "Mr."? Now I come to
    think of it, there is an Englishman, not unconnected with
    dramatic literature, who is known nowadays as WILLIAM, without
    the prefix of Mister, but in his own time he was known as
    Master WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE, and Master he remains. "But this,"
    as Mr. RUDYARD KIPLING might observe, "is quite another
    WILLIAM."</p>

    <p>I have not the original for reference handy, but the version
    played at Terry's Theatre bears internal evidence of a close
    translation. An adapter, I fancy, with a free hand would
    scarcely have made one of the characters use the same exit
    speech on two occasions. <i>Nils Krogstad</i> does this. He can
    think of nothing better than, "If I am flung into the gutter,
    you shall accompany me," repeated twice with the slight
    variation, "If I am flung into the gutter for the second time,
    you shall accompany me," used for the last exit. Again,
    <i>Torvald Helmer</i> has a long monologue in the final Act
    that a practised playwright would have "broken up" with the
    assistance of a portrait, or a letter, or something. From this
    it would appear that the Editor, WILLIAM ARCHER (without the
    "Mr.") has very faithfully produced the exact translation of
    the original. To be hypercritical, I might suggest that perhaps
    occasionally the version is rather <i>too</i> literal. For
    instance, <i>Torvald Helmer</i>, although he is cursed with one
    of the most offensive wives known to creation, would scarcely
    call her "a little lark," which conveys the impression that he
    is a "gay dog," and one given to the traditional ways of that
    species of ultra-sociable animals. I have confessed I have not
    the original before me, so I cannot say whether the title used
    by IBSEN is "<i>Smalle Larke</i>," but I fancy that a "capering
    capercailzie," if not actually his <i>words</i>, would be
    nearer his <i>meaning</i>. A capercailzie is, according to the
    dictionaries, a bird of "a delicious flavour" and partially
    "green;" it is also found in Norway "very fine and large," as
    IBSEN might say. Surely <i>Torvald</i> would have thus
    described his semi-verdant <i>Nora</i>, finding her distinctly
    to his taste.</p>

    <p>Returning to what I venture to imagine must be "new matter"
    not in the Herman-<i>plus</i>-Jonesian version, I consider the
    scene in which <i>Nora</i> chaffs <i>Dr. Rank</i> about his
    illness absolutely nauseous, and the drink-inspired admiration
    of husband for wife in the concluding Act repulsive to the last
    degree. On Tuesday the spectators received the piece with
    patient apathy; and, this being the case, I could not help
    feeling that anyone who could single out such a play as
    suitable for performance before an English audience, could
    scarcely possess the acumen generally considered a necessary
    adjunct to the qualifications of an efficient Dramatic Critic.
    The hero, the heroine, the doctor, as prigs, could only appeal
    to prigs, and thank goodness the average London theatre-goer is
    the reverse of a prig. There was but one redeeming point in the
    play&mdash;its conclusion. It ends happily in <i>Nora</i>,
    forger, liar, and&mdash;hem&mdash;wedded flirt, being separated
    from her innocent children.</p>

    <p>For the rest, the piece was fairly well acted. But when the
    Curtain had fallen for the last time, and the audience were
    departing more in sadness than in anger, I could not help
    asking myself the question, Had the advantages obtained in
    witnessing the performance balanced the expense incurred in
    securing a seat? I am forced to reply in the negative, as I
    sign myself regretfully,</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>I see three ladies in a drawing-room, each with a green
    volume. "What is it?" No, they won't hear. Each one is intent
    on her volume, and an irritable answer, in a don't bother kind
    of manner, is all that I can obtain. The novel is Miss
    BRADDON's latest, <i>One Life, One Love</i> (but three volumes,
    for all that), in which they are absorbed. Later on, at
    intervals, I get the volumes, and, raven-like, secrete them. I
    can quite understand the absorption of my young friends.
    Marvellous, Miss BRADDON! Very few have approached you in
    sensation-writing, and none in keeping up sensationalism as
    fresh as ever it was when first I sat up at night nervously to
    read <i>Aurora Floyd</i>, and <i>Lady Audley's Secret</i>. In
    this bad time of year (I am writing when the snow is without,
    and the North-East wind is engaged in cutting leaves), the
    Baron recommends remaining indoors with this Three-volume Novel
    as a between lunch and dinner companion, only don't take it up
    to your bed-room, and sit over the fire with it, or&mdash;but
    there, I won't mention the consequences. Keep it till daylight
    doth appear. The Baron being a busy man&mdash;no, Sir, not a
    busy-body,&mdash;is grateful to the authors of good short
    stories in Magazines. Many others agree with the Baron, who
    wishes to recommend "Saint or Satan" in <i>The Argosy</i>; The
    story of an "Old Beau," which might have been advantageously
    abbreviated in <i>Scribner</i>; an odd tale entitled, "The
    Phantom Portrait," in the <i>Cornhill</i>; which leaves the
    reader in doubt as to whether he has been egregiously "sold" or
    not; and, above all, the short and interesting&mdash;too short
    and most interesting&mdash;paper on THACKERAY, in <i>Harper's
    Monthly</i>, with fac-similes of some of the great humorist's
    most eccentric and most spirited illustrations, conceived in
    the broadly burlesquing spirit that was characteristic of
    GILRAY and ROWLANDSON. THACKERAY, philosopher and satirist, who
    can take us behind the scenes of every show in <i>Vanity
    fair</i>, who can depict the career of the scoundrel <i>Barry
    Lyndon</i>, of the heathen <i>Becky Sharp</i>, and the
    death-bed of the Christian soldier and gentleman,
    <i>dignissimus, Colonel Newcome</i>, could on occasion, and
    when a rollicking spirit moved him, put on a pantomime mask
    (have we not his own pathetic vignette representing him doing
    this?) to amuse the children, or give us some rare burlesque
    writing and drawing to set us all on the broad grin. The Baron
    trusts that Mrs. RITCHIE will give us more of this, and
    sincerely hopes that there may be a "lot more" caricatures in
    that portfolio "where these came from." I heartily thank you
    for so much, and respectfully ask for more, says yours, very
    gratefully,</p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;Why should ARISTOTLE be the only
    author whose works get discovered? I found the following story,
    written on papyrus, and enclosed in a copper cylinder, in my
    back garden, and I am positive that it is not ARISTOTLE. Can it
    possibly have been written by that amiable and instructive
    authoress whose stories for children have recently been
    reprinted? Yours, &amp;c., HENRY ST. OTLE.</p>

    <p>CHARLIE was a very obedient little boy, and his sister SARAH
    was a good, patient little girl. One beautiful summer's day
    they went to stay for a week with their Uncle WILLIAM, a man of
    very high principles, who was not quite used to the proper
    method with children. On the evening of their arrival, as they
    were seated in front of the fire, CHARLIE lifted up his bright,
    obedient, beautiful face, and said, thoughtfully:</p>

    <p>"Pray, Uncle WILLIAM, cannot we have one of those
    instructive and amusing conversations such as children love,
    about refraction, and relativity, and initial velocity, and
    Mesopotamia generally?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, yes, Uncle WILLIAM!" said SARAH, pausing to wipe her
    patient little nose; "Our dear Papa is always so pleasant and
    polysyllabic on these subjects."</p>

    <p>Then Uncle WILLIAM regretted that he had paid less attention
    in his youth to the shilling science primers, but he pulled
    himself together and determined to do his best. "Certainly, my
    dear children, nothing could please me more. Now here I have a
    jug and a glass. You will observe that I pour some water from
    the jug into the glass. This illustrates one of the properties
    of water. Can you tell me what I mean?"</p>

    <p>"Fluidity!" said both the children, with enthusiasm.</p>

    <p>"Yes, quite so, and&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;has a brick
    fluidity?"</p>

    <p>"Why, no, Uncle WILLIAM!"</p>

    <p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;<i>why</i> hasn't it?" asked Uncle
    WILLIAM, with something almost like desperation in his
    voice.</p>

    <p>"That, Uncle," said the obedient CHARLIE, "is one of the
    things which we should like to learn from you to-night."</p>

    <p>"Yes, we shall come to that; but, in order to make you
    understand it better, I must carry my experiment a little
    further. In this decanter I have what is called whiskey. I pour
    some of it into the water. Now it is more usual to put the
    whiskey in first, and the water afterwards. Can you tell me why
    that is so? Think it out for yourselves." And Uncle WILLIAM
    smiled genially.</p>

    <p>There was silence for a few moments. Then little SARAH said,
    timidly: "I think it must be because, when a man wishes to
    drink, whiskey is the first thing which naturally occurs to his
    mind. He does not think about water until afterwards."</p>

    <p>"Quite right. That is the explanation of the scientists. And
    why do you think I put in the water first and the whiskey
    afterwards?"</p>

    <p>"It was," said CHARLIE, brightly, "in order that we might
    not see so exactly how much whiskey you took."</p>

    <p>"No, that's quite wrong. I did it out of sheer originality.
    Now what would happen if I drank this curious mixture?"</p>

    <p>"You would be breaking the pledge, Uncle WILLIAM," said both
    children, promptly and heartily.</p>

    <p>"Wrong again. I should be acting under doctor's orders."</p>

    <p>"Why hasn't a brick any fluidity?" asked SARAH,
    patiently.</p>

    <p>"Don't interrupt, my dear child. We're coming to that. Now,
    CHARLIE, when you eat or drink anything, where does it go?"</p>

    <p>"It goes into my little&mdash;oh, no, Uncle, I cannot say
    that word," and CHARLIE, who was of a singularly modest and
    refined disposition, buried his face in his hands, and blushed
    deeply.</p>

    <p>"Admirable!" exclaimed Uncle WILLIAM. "One cannot be too
    refined. Call it the blank. It goes into your blank. Well,
    whiskey raises the tone of the blank. Just as, when you screw
    up the peg of a violin, you raise the tone of the string. By
    drinking this I raise the tone of my blank." He suited the
    action to the word.</p>

    <p>"Now you'll be screwed," said CHARLIE, "like the pegs of
    the&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"On one glass of weak whiskey-and-water&mdash;never!"</p>

    <p>"But why hasn't a brick any fluidity?" asked SARAH, quite
    patiently.</p>

    <p>"First of all, listen to this. That whiskey-and-water is now
    inside me. I want you to understand what <i>inside</i> means.
    Go and stand in the passage, and shut the door of this room
    after you."</p>

    <p>"But, Uncle," said SARAH, patiently, "why hasn't a brick
    any&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Hush, SARAH, hush!" said the obedient CHARLIE. "It is our
    duty to obey Uncle WILLIAM in all things."</p>

    <p>So the two children went out of the room, and shut the door
    after them. Uncle WILLIAM went to the door, and locked it.</p>

    <p>"Now then," he said, cheerily, "I am inside. And where are
    you?"</p>

    <p>"Outside."</p>

    <p>"Yes&mdash;and outside you'll stop. One of the servants will
    put you to bed." And Uncle WILLIAM went back to the
    decanter.</p>

            <p>When I saw you on "a January morning,"</p>

            <p class="i2">With a very little pair of skates

            <p>And the frosty glow your fairy face adorning,</p>

            <p class="i2">I was suddenly from other passions

    <h3>STRANGE, BUT TRUE.</h3>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;Under the heading of "Ecclesiastical
    Intelligence" in the <i>Times</i> of Saturday, I read that,
    "The LORD CHANCELLOR has preferred the Rev. W.R. WELCH, of
    Hull, to the Vicarage of Withernwick, East Yorkshire," I
    presume the LORD CHANCELLOR knows both the gentleman and the
    place thoroughly, and so wisely elects which he prefers; but to
    one who, like myself and thousands of others, know neither, it
    strikes me that I would certainly prefer the place to the
    parson, however worthy. It is, indeed, gratifying to see that
    the Highest Representative of Law and Order in the realm, after
    HER GRACIOUS MAJESTY, is so utterly uninfluenced by any
    mercenary motives. I send this by Private Post, an old soldier,
    and am yours enthusiastically,</p>

    <p>"BETTER LATE THAN NEVER."&mdash;Two Jurymen, says a
    paragraph in last Saturday's <i>Times</i>, wrote to the
    Solicitor acting for a female prisoner, one CUTLER, who had
    been convicted of perjury and sentenced at Chester, to say that
    they "gave in to a verdict of Guilty because it was very late,
    and one gentleman had an important business engagement at
    home." This recalls the line, "And wretches hang that Jurymen
    may dine." The remainder of ELLEN CUTLER's sentence of five
    years' penal servitude is remitted. It is satisfactory to know
    that these two had the courage of their opinions before it was
    too late.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, Jan. 26.</i>&mdash;PLUNKET
    undoubtedly the most successful Commissioner of Works of recent
    times. A little coolness sprung up between him and CAVENDISH
    BENTINCK about those staircases in Westminster Hall. But
    <i>chacun a son</i> idea of a staircase. PLUNKET quite as
    likely to be right as C.B. Always doing something to improve
    arrangements of House. Does it quietly, too; Members know
    nothing about it till they come down and find new Smoking-room,
    fresh arrangements of lights, new rooms for Ministers, and
    occasionally a priceless old table adorning Tea-room. Various
    accounts of its origin. Some say Magna Charta signed on it.
    Others fixing earlier date and attracted by the initials "W.R."
    clearly carved on left leg, affirm that it is the very table on
    which WILLIAM REX took his five o'clock tea after Battle of
    Hastings.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/71-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/71-2.png"
             alt="'Dear me!'" /></a>"Dear me!"
    </div>

    <p>Latest surprise prepared by First Commissioner is
    illumination of entrance to House from Lobby, cunningly
    effected by electric lights set within recesses of arch.
    SCHNAD-HORST, revisiting House after long interval, astonished
    at this. "Making things very comfortable in anticipation of our
    coming in," he says, smiling sweetly.</p>

    <p>Later came upon NICHOLAS WOODS; found him standing in
    attitude of patient and intelligent expectation. "What are you
    waiting there for?" I asked. "Why don't you come in and hear
    SWINBURNE make one or two speeches on Tithes
    Bill?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"
       id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span>

    <p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;fact is," said NICHOLAS, steadfastly
    keeping his eyes on archway, "WILFRID LAWSON told me that if I
    was here about eleven o'clock I would see PLUNKET and the
    ATTORNEY-GENERAL come out under the archway dancing a <i>pas de
    deux</i>. Couldn't make out when I arrived what the
    illumination was for; asked LAWSON. 'Oh' says he, 'it's the
    First Commissioner's reminiscence of one of the alcoves at
    Vauxhall Gardens.' Then he told me about PLUNKET and WEBSTER.
    Thought I'd like to see it. Do you think it's all right?"</p>

    <p>"Well," I said, "ALBERT ROLLIT <i>did</i> tell me something
    about ATTORNEY-GENERAL going on the Spree. But that was in
    Germany, and he had his skates with him. Don't know how it'll
    be here. You mustn't forget that WILFRID's something of a wag.
    Wouldn't advise you to wait much after eleven o'clock."</p>

    <p>House engaged all night on Tithes Bill. Not particularly
    lively. Towards midnight TANNER, preternaturally quiet since
    House met, suddenly woke up, and, <i>à propos de bottes</i>,
    moved to report progress. COURTNEY down on him like cartload of
    bricks; declined to put Motion, declaring it abuse of forms of
    House. This rather depressing. In good old times there would
    have been an outburst of indignation in Irish camp; Chairman's
    ruling challenged, and squabble agreeably occupied rest of
    evening. But times changed. No Irish present to back TANNER,
    who, with despairing look round, subsided, and business went
    forward without further check.</p>

             alt="Exit!" /></a>Exit!
    </div>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;Mr. DICK DE LISLE came down to House
    to-night full of high resolve. Hadn't yet been a Member of
    House when it shook from time to time with the roar of
    controversy round BRADLAUGH, his oath, his affirmation, and his
    stylographic pen. At that time was in Singapore, helping Sir
    FREDERICK WELD to govern the Straits Settlement. But had
    watched controversy closely, and had contributed to its
    settlement by writing a luminous treatise, entitled, <i>The
    Parliamentary Oath</i>. Now, by chance, the question cropped up
    again. BRADLAUGH had secured first place on to-night's order
    for his Motion rescinding famous Resolution of June, 1880,
    declaring him ineligible to take his seat. BRADLAUGH ill in
    bed; sick unto death, as it seemed; but HUNTER had taken up
    task for him, and would move Resolution. Of course the
    Government would oppose it; if necessary, DE LISLE would assist
    them with argument. In any case, they should have his vote.
    Heard SOLICITOR-GENERAL with keen satisfaction. He showed not
    only the undesirability and impossibility of acceding to
    proposition, but denounced it as "absolutely childish." Mr. G.
    followed; but Mr. G. said the same kind of things eleven years
    ago, when he was Leader of triumphant party, and had been
    defeated again and again. Of course same fate awaited him now.
    Government had spoken through mouth of SOLICITOR-GENERAL, and
    there was an end on't.</p>

    <p>Not quite. STAFFORD NORTHCOTE, unaccustomed participant in
    debate, presented himself. Stood immediately behind OLD
    MORALITY, by way of testifying to his unaltered loyalty. At
    same time he suggested that, after all, would be as well to
    humour BRADLAUGH and his friends, and strike out Resolution.
    Then OLD MORALITY rose from side of SOLICITOR-GENERAL, and,
    unmindful of that eminent Lawyer's irresistible argument and
    uncompromising declaration, said, "on the whole," perhaps
    NORTHCOTE was right, and so mote it be.</p>

    <p>The elect of Mid-Leicestershire gasped for air. Did his ears
    deceive him, or was this the end of the famous BRADLAUGH
    incidents? OLD MORALITY, in his cheerful way, suggested that,
    as they were doing the thing, they had better do it
    unanimously. General cheer approved. DE LISLE started to his
    feet. One voice, at least, should be heard in protest against
    this shameful surrender. Began in half-choked voice: evidently
    struggling against some strange temptation; talked about the
    Parnell Commission; accused House of legalising atheism, and
    whitewashing treason; argued at length with Mr. G. on doctrine
    of excess of jurisdiction. Observed, as he went on, to be
    waving his hands as if repelling some object; turned his head
    on one side as if he would fain escape apparition; House looked
    on wonderingly. At length, with something like subdued sob, DE
    LISLE gave way, and Members learned what had troubled him. It
    was dear old <i>Mr. Dick's</i> complaint. Standing up to
    present his Memorial against tergiversation of OLD MORALITY, DE
    LISLE could not help dragging in head of CHARLES THE FIRST. "As
    a Royalist," he said, "I should maintain that the House of
    Commons exceeded its jurisdiction when it ordered King CHARLES
    THE FIRST to be beheaded, but I never heard that it was
    proposed, after the Restoration, to expunge the Resolution from
    the books."</p>

    <p>Irreverent House went off into roars of laughter, amid which
    <i>Mr. Dick</i>, more than ever bewildered, sat down, and
    presently went out to ask <i>Miss Betsy Trottwood</i> why they
    laughed.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Resolution of June, 1880,
    declaring BRADLAUGH ineligible to sit, expunged from
    journals.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;As OLD MORALITY finely says, "The
    worm persistently incommoded by inconvenient attentions will
    finally assume an aggressive attitude." So it has proved
    to-night. SYDNEY GEDGE long been object of contumelious
    attention. Members jeer at him when he rises; talk whilst he
    orates; laugh when he is serious, are serious when he is
    facetious. But the wounded worm has turned at last. SYDNEY has
    struck. GEDGE has been goaded once too often.</p>

    <p>It was COURTNEY brought it about. Been six hours in Chair in
    Committee on Tithes Bill; feeling faint and weary, glad to
    refresh himself with sparkling conversation of Grand Young
    GARDNER; GEDGE on his feet at moment in favourite oratorial
    attitude; pulverising Amendment moved by GRAY; thought, as he
    proceeded, he heard another voice. Could it be? Yes; it was
    Chairman of Committees conversing with frivolous elderly young
    man whilst he (S.G.) was debating the Tithes Bill! Should he
    pass over this last indignity? No; honour of House must be
    vindicated; lofty standard of debate must be maintained; the
    higher the position of offender the more urgent his duty to
    strike a blow. Was standing at the moment aligned with Chair;
    paused in argument; faced about to the right and marched with
    solemn steps to the end of Gangway, the Bench having been
    desolated by his speech so far as it had gone.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:18%;">
        <a href="images/72-2.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="In revolt." /></a>In revolt.
    </div>

    <p>"Sir," he said, bending angry brows on Chairman, "I am
    afraid my speech interrupted your conversation. Therefore I
    have moved further away."</p>

    <p>That was all, but it was enough. HERBERT GARDNER slunk away,
    COURTNEY hastily turned over pages of the Bill; hung down his
    guilty head, and tried to look as if it were MILMAN who had
    been engaged in conversation. Now MILMAN was asleep.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Level flow of Debate on Tithes
    Bill interrupted by revolt of SYDNEY GEDGE.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Rather a disappointing evening from
    Opposition point of view. In advance, was expected to be
    brilliant field-night. Irish Administration to be attacked all
    along line; necessity for new departure demonstrated.
    SHAW-LEFEVRE led off with Resolution demanding establishment of

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
